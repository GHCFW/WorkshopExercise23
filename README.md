# WorkshopExercise23

<br>

This workshop is divided into a series of exercises to showcase a few important firmware concepts. We will start with the exercises on the a simulator before moving to the physical board. For this workshop we will utilize a free online simulator called [Wokwi](https://wokwi.com/) and use Raspberry Pi Pico as a vehicle to demonstrate the power of firmware. After getting the code to work on the simulator, we will configure the Raspberry Pi Pico physical board.
