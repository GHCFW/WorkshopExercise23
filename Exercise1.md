## The Power of Firmware - Bringing Your Hardware to Life Workshop

Welcome to "The Power of Firmware - Bringing Your Hardware to Life" workshop! In this workshop, you'll learn firmware concepts used regularly and materialize them by creating a simple and fun game that determines the fastest button press between two players using a Raspberry Pi Pico board.

### Prerequisites

Before you start, make sure you have completed the following prerequisites:

- [Install Thonny](prerequisite.md#step-1-install-thonny): Thonny is a Python IDE that we'll use to program the Raspberry Pi Pico. It's essential for this workshop.

### Getting Started with Wokwi

1. **Wokwi Simulation**: We'll start by simulating the game on the Wokwi platform. Follow this link to open the simulation: [Wokwi Simulation](https://wokwi.com/projects/375362750523243521).

2. **Understanding the Code**: Take a look at the provided Python code in `main.py`. We've added comments to explain the code step by step. It includes concepts like GPIO (General-Purpose Input/Output) pins and interrupts which we discussed earlier

3. **Running the Simulation**: On the Wokwi platform, you can't truly play the game because you can't press both buttons at once. However, you can observe how the code works by clicking the "Start Simulation" button.

4. **Exploring Concepts**: While in the simulation, explore how GPIO pins are used to read button presses and how interrupts are triggered when a button is pressed. This will be essential when you move to the hardware board.
